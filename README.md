# Generative AI with the PaLM Model

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for exploring the capabilities of the PaLM (Pathway Language Model) generative AI model from Google AI. PaLM is a 540-billion parameter, dense decoder-only Transformer model trained with the Pathways system on 6144 TPU v4 chips using the Pathways system. It is capable of generating text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.

## Key Features

Text Generation: PaLM can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.
Multilingual: PaLM is trained on a massive dataset of text and code in 540 languages, allowing it to generate text and translate languages across a wide range of languages.
Reasoning: PaLM excels at tasks that require logical reasoning and complex thinking, such as solving math problems and writing different kinds of creative text formats.
Code Generation: PaLM can generate code from natural language descriptions, making it a powerful tool for developers.
Grounded Responses: PaLM can access and process information from the real world through Google Search, allowing it to provide more comprehensive and informative responses.
## Getting Started

Prerequisites:

A Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account
The Google Cloud SDK installed and configured
Instructions:

Create a GCP project.
Enable the Vertex AI API for your project.
Install the Vertex AI SDK.
Create a service account with the roles/vertexai.user role.
Download the service account key file.
Set the GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS environment variable to the path of the service account key file.
Run the following code to create a PaLM model instance:
## Python
from google.cloud import aiplatform

client = aiplatform.gapic.EndpointServiceClient(client_options={"api_endpoint": "us-central1-aiplatform.googleapis.com"})

endpoint = client.create_endpoint(
    display_name="palm-endpoint",
    project="your-project-id",
    location="us-central1",
    deployable_models=["544954655441546545445546"],
)

Once the endpoint is created, you can send requests to it using the Vertex AI SDK.
## Examples

See the examples directory for examples of how to use the PaLM model for various tasks.
